### The easy and secure Fastcoin wallet

Fastwallet is the best way to get started with Fastcoin. Our simple, streamliÃ¥ned design is easy for beginners, yet powerful enough for experienced users. 

iOS Users can visit the iOS version of the code here: [Fastwallet iOS](https://github.com/fastcoin-foundation/loafwallet-ios) 

##### Completely decentralized

Unlike other iOS Fastcoin wallets, **Fastwallet** is a standalone Fastcoin client. It connects directly to the Fastcoin network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if Fastwallet is removed from the App Store, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their valuable Fastcoin at any time.

##### Cutting-edge security

**Fastwallet** utilizes AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and the latest iOS security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. Private keys are stored only in the secure enclave of the user's phone, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

##### Designed with new users in mind

Simplicity and ease-of-use is **Fastwallet**'s core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which we call a paper key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. **Fastwallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the paper key.
